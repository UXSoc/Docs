All our projects are design-led, starting with post-its and sketching, ending
with design implemented as code in the app. We use design sprints and user
research to understand our client's problems, validate assumptions about the
products, and build products that are user-centered.

## Introduction to Product Design Sprints

> "Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like.
> People think it's this veneer â€” that the designers are handed this box and
> told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just
> what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

[Product Design
Sprints](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint) an invention
of [Google Ventures' Design Team](http://www.gv.com/team/#design), are 5-phase
exercises intended to improve the chances of [making something people
want](http://paulgraham.com/good.html). We want to turn false confidence into
validated confidence before beginning an expensive build. Or, we want to dodge
bullets by learning we shouldn't begin the expensive build at all.

Sprints are useful starting points when kicking off a new product or workflow,
as well as solving problems with an existing product. They typically last 5 days
but we have done them in less time. We get as many stakeholders and expertises
in the room as we can.

Product design sprints are test-driven design.

## Phase 0: Prepare

Before the sprint, our clients schedule 5 real humans for the tests we'll do in
the last phase. They know their users better than we do.

They also gather research from sources such as:

- Quora
- Google Analytics
- Adwords Keyword Planner

We may also do some prep-work:

- Schedule and run  [user
  interviews](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interviewing-users/)
- Deploy a short [survey](https://www.typeform.com/) whose results we can
review in the first place

We typically order breakfast for the first day to make it feel special but don't
order lunch for each day of the sprint. For both the sprints and normal days, we
believe it's important to not have "working lunches", instead breaking from work
for a short time to rest the brain, maybe get some fresh air, and interact with
teammates and clients.

## Phase 1: Understand

The exercises in this phase help us understand and empathize with the users'
life (consumer software) or work (business software) needs.

Throughout the phase, people take notes, often on sticky notes that they stick
to the walls of the room.

We start with "pitch practice", where the client pitches their product like they
would to investors. This helps us identify the user, their problem, and the job
they are hiring the product to do. It also begins documenting the [vocabulary
used in the domain](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html).

We then review research from Quora, Analytics, AdWords Keyword Planner,
interviews, and surveys. This helps us understand users' motivation, the
marketing funnel, and the size of target markets.

Lastly, we sketch what the rest of the sprint will focus on: the critical path
for the software. At this point, we try to keep this high-level and as light on
implementation details as possible. A great question to help generate the
critical path is:

> What job is the user hiring the product to do?

We will edit the critical path as we move through the phases.

## Phase 2: Diverge

The exercises in this phase help us exhaust our imaginations for potential
solutions that meet the users' needs.

Before this phase, the team naturally walks around the room reviewing the walls,
covered in the critical path and lots of sticky notes.

We start with "pitch practice" again, comparing to the critical path.

We then have each person individually sketch 10+ [user flows](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows) and user interfaces.
We ask people to include the sources where the customer will come from: Twitter?
A blog post? AdWords? Automated suggestions? Drip email? Referral from a friend?
Push notification?

Should the product become realized, these sources should eventually be measured
in [Google Analytics' "Acquisition Channels"
report](https://analytics.googleblog.com/2013/10/new-acquisitions-reporting-channels.html):

![](/img/acquisition-channels.jpg)

We then put those sketches on the wall and begin a silent critique, observing
and putting [dot stickers] on different parts of the flows and user interfaces
that we like. This helps visually identify the best ideas.

We then do a group critique, three minutes per idea. The group explains their
dots. The author can then add any extra commentary. We don't shoot down any
ideas or start winnowing. This voting process helps avoid long discussions and
design-by-committee.

Lastly, we do a "super vote" with larger, red dot stickers. The CEO or other
product owner will place a single "super vote" on what they think is the best
idea. This helps us reflect the reality of how their organization makes
decisions and affirm their ultimate authority.

Our experience has been that this phase is mentally exhausting. We recommend
ending early and sending people home to re-charge their batteries.

## Phase 3: Converge

The exercises in this phase force us to stop generating new solutions, converge
on the best, and write the test for the prototype.

First, we identify assumptions we're making in the best ideas. We list all
assumptions about users' motivations, the business model, our ability to acquire
users, and our ability to implement the solution within budget. This helps
eliminate some options.

![](/img/assumptions.jpg)

We then look for conflicts in the remaining sticky notes, user flows, and user
interfaces: ideas that aim to solve the same problem in different ways. We
eliminate solutions that can't be pursued currently.

We then decide whether we're creating one prototype ("best shot") or multiple
("battle royale"). Multiple prototypes are more initial work but may reveal more
dead ends and help us dodge more bullets without running follow-on sprints.

We then storyboard each prototype. This is a comic book-style story of our
customer moving through the critical path.

Lastly, we create the testing script in Google Docs and put the scoreboard on
the wall of the observation room. The script is based on the storyboard and the
scoreboard will be used to record the results of the test. This helps us be very
explicit about what we're trying to learn.

## Phase 4: Prototype

After another pitch practice to rally the troops, there are no exercises in this
phase. It is entirely focused on building the right prototype(s) with just the
right amount of fidelity to generate useful test results.

For the entire phase, we ask our clients to write copy text in Google Docs. They
write [real text, not lorem ipsum](https://tbot.io/use-real-words), in order to
test user understanding and enthusiasm. This text is also useful later for
tweets, press, ad copy, landing pages, etc.

While our clients are busy getting communication polished, we are heads-down
prototyping. We use different tools depending on the designer and the project.

For web app prototypes, some good options are:

- [Figma](www.figma.com) for multiplayer editing
- [Squarespace] templates
- [Bourbon](bourbon.io) + [Neat](neat.bourbon.io) +
  [Bitters](bitters.bourbon.io)
- [Invision](www.invisionapp.com)

For mobile app prototypes, some good options are:

- [Flinto](https://www.flinto.com) + [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com)
- [Prototyping on Paper](https://popapp.in)

Your chapter may offer free licenses on behalf of the organization. Get in
contact with the VP of UX Design at your chapter.

Don't try to learn these tools during the sprint. Get familiar with them during
investment time. During the sprint, use one that you've mastered.

## Phase 5: Test and Learn

Finally, we interview 5 users to test our understanding of them, their context,
and our prototype. This is not a usability test. We begin the conversation as an
interview before showing them the prototype.

One of our designers interviews each user. We set them up in an interview room
with video and audio streaming to the observation, where the rest of the
stakeholders are watching, discussing, and recording answers on the scoreboard.

Good questions are open-ended to allow users to tell stories.

> "Could you tell us about a time you donated to a non-profit?"

Don't lead users to an expected answer.

> "Would you donate money to a public school if you could?"

Don't close the conversation.

> "Have you donated money to an organization within the last week?"

For a new product, it's unlikely that any team will nail it their first sprint.
The most likely outcome is that we'll want to run a follow-on sprint starting at
Diverge or Converge and test again with new users.

After one or two sprints, we typically have many assumptions validated, a clear
critical path established, and are ready to begin coding a first version to
release to a wider audience.

We end the phase with a plan for moving forward.
