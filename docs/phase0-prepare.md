Before the sprint, our clients schedule 5 real humans for the tests we'll do in
the last phase. They know their users better than we do.

They also gather research from sources such as:

- Quora
- Google Analytics
- Adwords Keyword Planner

We may also do some prep-work:

- Schedule and run  [user
  interviews](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interviewing-users/)
- Deploy a short [survey](https://www.typeform.com/) whose results we can
review in the first place

We typically order breakfast for the first day to make it feel special but don't
order lunch for each day of the sprint. For both the sprints and normal days, we
believe it's important to not have "working lunches", instead breaking from work
for a short time to rest the brain, maybe get some fresh air, and interact with
teammates and clients.
