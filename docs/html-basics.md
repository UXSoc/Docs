'HTML' stands for Hypertext Markup Language, lets break down what that means. Hypertext just means that text can link to other text, like how you can <a href="webdev-intro">go back to the intro by clicking here</a>. Markup Language indicates that HTML is only used for document layout, not as a programming language like <a href="/">JavaScript</a>.

**HTML documents provide the content for a website.**

### How to write

HTML is written through a series of tag, formatted like this:
```
<p>Text</p>
``` 
Most tags have an opening (`<p>`) and closing tag (`</p>`) and content inside each. The `/` is used in only the closing tag to show that it is closing.

Some tags only have an opening tag like `<img>`:
```
<img src="img_location.png" height="42" width="42">
``` 

### Important tags

- `<p>Text Here</p>` Paragraph tag, used for text.
- `<div></div>` Divider tag, used to separate up content.
- `<a href="https://www.google.com/">Link text</a>` Link tag, href is where the link goes when clicked on.

  Unlike in movies and television shows HTML can't be used as a hacking tool because it isn't a programming language.
