All our projects are design-centric, starting with post-its and sketching, ending
with design implemented as code in the app. We use design sprints and user
research to understand our client's problems, validate assumptions about the
products, and build products that are user-centered.

## Introduction to Product Design Sprints

> "Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like.
> People think it's this veneer â€” that the designers are handed this box and
> told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just
> what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

[Product Design
Sprints](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint), an invention
of [Google Ventures' Design Team](http://www.gv.com/team/#design), are 5-phase
exercises intended to improve the chances of [making something people
want](http://paulgraham.com/good.html). We want to turn false confidence into
validated confidence before beginning an expensive build. Or, we want to dodge
bullets by learning we shouldn't begin the expensive build at all.

Sprints are useful starting points when kicking off a new product or workflow,
as well as solving problems with an existing product. They typically last 5 days
but we have done them in less time because we try to get as many stakeholders
and expertises in the room as we can.

Product design sprints are test-driven design.
