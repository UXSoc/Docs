JavaScript is a programming language and adds functionality to websites. Unlike HTML and CSS there isn't a standard way to write JavaScript.

### Output
Get output from JavaScript with a single line:
```
console.log("Hello World");
```
<script>
    console.log("Hello World");
</script>
Navigate to this webpage's console with Right-click > Inspect > click on the 'Console' tab. Then you can see this in action.

### Overview
JavaScript is too complex of of a language to give enough of a tutorial here, however here are the broad concepts of it:
- **Object Oriented** meaning code is split up into modular sections so that they can be used easier.
- **Scripted** Unlike complied languages (C++, Swift, etc.) Javascript is interpreted so you only need to provide it it html and it will run.
- **Dynamic** which  means that variables can hold any type of data.

#### Great resources to start learning more about JavaScript:
- [Mozilla Web Docs: JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) 
- [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) if you want to try it out in browser.
