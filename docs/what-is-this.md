Thanks for checking out this website, hope it can be helpful! The main purposes are: 
# Education
There is plenty of material that applies to UXSoc, and including user experience itself, product design, and development.
Of course everything can't be covered in depth, but should hopefully set you on the right path to discover everything you could learn and more.

#### This of this site like a library catalog for everything UXSoc, a portal to anything  

# Documentation

Especially in the <a href="webdev-intro">'Develop'</a> section, this should act as a way to store how other projects were done, and more importantly *why*.


Documentation should cover:
- Best practices, with justification
- Where to find old projects that are relevant and work well as an example
- Tools used, to best build a cohesive process as an organization
