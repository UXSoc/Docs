Web development is a broad and large topic with many different solutions to suite various project needs. We will go over which technologies we recommend and why along with basic information and a starting place for each.

Normal guides break web development into front-end and back-end technologies, but because of how blurred that line has become in modern times, it will be covered more generally.

#### Topics covered
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Running A Website
