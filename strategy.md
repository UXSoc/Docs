# New User Issues
Ranked in order of what I think are the most problematic, some may need to be reordered

1. Have difficulties reading, having trouble understanding written instructions

1. Don't know where to start looking for a solution to a problem, may not even understand the problem

1. Fear of the unknown and generally with quit instead of trying to solve a problem

1. Low drive for learning web development or other types of development

1. Lack of basic experience, which makes training much slower epically combined with previous points

1. Large spread of different OS and hardware which makes it hard to assist and recommend solutions for new members

1. Unwillingness to put in time outside of meetings which makes learning slower


# What user wants to do


- Most people seem to want to go into a some type of software industry job (would need to survey)

- Members seem to mostly want to work on UX Coin or our site, although overall excitement for webdev seems low. Maybe because we haven't really started

- Unifying factor is everyone wants to go into a lucrative job/do well paying work

- A couple people are more interested in the business aspect

# Solutions

- More pictures in documentation. Limit screenshots of words or else it is the same problem

- Make each entries short and concise. Documentation should aim to provide the minimum amount of set-up so members can start asking questions

- Add a footer to each article that directs users to ask questions to appropriate members  

- Make intro as gentle as possible. May want to consider dropping Github and just having members editing html-starter without version control.

- Use GUI as much as possible, have good documentation for it

- Document the extreme basics of webdev, make it as easy to refer back to as possibly by allowing users to bookmarks documentation pages internally

- Make documentation as hype as possible, act excited

- Have a branching path solution for different Operating Systems, like a flow chart. see https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap

- Have experienced members learn different hardware/software other than personal preference
